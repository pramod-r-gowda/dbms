<h3>For how many years can a good cow produce milk?</h3>
Generally life of the cow is 15-20 years and the commercial life time is 8 years, that is 4 to 5 lactation from the date of its birth. Till 8 years it gives good milk from calf period of first 3 years to cow period of later 5 years.

<h3>What to do with the animal after its commercial life is over?</h3>Some people sell them to butchers. Is there any other alternative to it?
For one farmer the viability is set in about 10 liter minimum milk production from a dairy cow, when it comes to 9 liter dairy production for x farmer it is not viable. However, the 9 liter can be viable for another farmer and so at that point of time sell the cow to another farmer but certainly not to the butchers.

Which breed of cow is good for dry weather condition?
Gir and Jersey cow are good for areas having high temperature. Even though these are exotic breeds it is good for hot places.

<h3>How to identify good quality cow or buffalo?</h3>
It is advisable when purchasing a cow go with a known local veterinary doctor as he would be a correct person to identify the good breed, healthy cow or a buffalo. It is strongly suggested to avoid agents as it might lead to some cheating.

Also, it is important to purchase the different breeds from the established geographical location. For example good HF breed cows are available in and around Bangalore, Hosur, Coimbatore or Ooty. In North India the good cows are available in Punjab and Haryana. In case of buffaloes, the good buffaloes are available in Punjab and Haryana and in some parts of Gujarat.

<h3>At the time of purchase what are the important factors to be considered?</h3>
The important factors to check when purchasing cow/buffalo are age, health condition, vaccination given, insurance, and the milk yield (if possible test at the site itself) of the animal. All these should be checked strictly.

<h3>What are the general care and medication for dairy animals?</h3>
Once an animal is purchased, take the insurance and provide proper medication facility. Vaccination is another medical part which should be strictly followed by all the dairy farmers at regular intervals. There are vaccines for FAMD and other diseases to be given during monsoon and towards May end. In addition, there are some vaccines that should be given regularly at an interval of 6 months or 1 year.

<h3>What are the necessary documents to be maintained for the farm’s dairy cattle?</h3>
Three important documents to be maintained are document for production, health and reproduction. Every animal in the farm should be given a proper identification number, and daily these animals’ details should be recorded and updated.

The biggest challenge in dairy farming is land for fodder. Land is costly these days. How do you suggest these challenges or costs can be mitigated?
If land for fodder is not available then it is best to go for contract farming. Even the nearby farmer can be contacted and deal can be fixed with him to supply the fodder continuously.

<h3>In contract fodder growing, how much is the farmer paid?</h3>
Generally the cost of production of the fodder if grown at owner’s farm would be 70-80 paise per kg. However, in case of contract fodder productions it may be 90 paise to Re 1 depending on the area.

<h3>What is  the diet chart for buffaloes?</h3>
The fodder requirement for a buffalo is about 30- 40 kgs and the concentration requirement depends on the milk production. The body maintenance of buffalo needs 1-1.5 kg concentrate. Regarding milk production, half kg concentrate is required for every one liter of milk. If a buffalo is giving 10 liters of milk one should give 6 – 6.5 kg concentrate with 30- 40 kg green fodder.

<h3>What is the diet chart for cows?</h3>
In the cows the difference will be in the concentrate feeding, for every one liter of milk production the cow needs to be given 400 grams of concentrate. Cows take less green fodder when compared with buffaloes.

<h3>How to identify the affordable plus good quality dairy equipment suppliers like milking machines?</h3>
<p class="sec">There are good milking machine suppliers like Alpha Lavel, De Lavel, Full Laval or Vanson. These are some good branded companies operating in India. One has to purchase from an authorized dealer and has to carefully select the equipment with respect to the quality aspect and the price aspect.</p>
